I started by giving chatgpt one large prompt that included things like background colors, overall structure of the content, each individual content box and its corresponding colors, and alighnment. From there, I gave it more specfic prompts to modify things such as text size/font and also details such as the spacing of the bullet points and the color of them. I would also go in and manually adjust some things in the CSS file, such as trying to find the exact colors and adjusting the margins to my liking, along with smaller details such as italics. I struggled to get the image of the octopus in the correct location relative to the header and the quiz questions/inputs. I tried going in manually to adjust for this but it enver turned out quite right and I had to re-prompt chatgpt on this multiple times as well, as the image often ended up inline with the header on the left side of it.

I think one of the most difficult things about this process is working backwards because it forces you to identify every little detail of the web page and the layout. I'm certain that I missed a few details, but it gave me insight into how intricate websites can be and it also showed me how much creative freedom one can have, despite still trying to replicate a screenshot. Every little detail has to be accounted for, from rounded corners to gradients to text shadows to bullet point colors.
